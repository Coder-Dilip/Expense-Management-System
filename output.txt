Dear Ministry of Education,

I am writing to request a change in the budget classification for Nepal's education sector.

The current budget classification system has been in place for many years and has not been updated to reflect the changing needs of Nepal's education system. The current budget classification does not adequately reflect the current needs of the education sector, and is not providing the necessary level of support to the sector.

I believe that the budget classification system should be updated to reflect the changing needs of the education sector, and to provide the necessary level of support to ensure that Nepal's education system is able to reach its full potential.

I believe that this change in budget classification would be beneficial for both the education sector and the country as a whole. It would ensure that the necessary level of support is provided to the sector, and would ensure that the sector is able to reach its full potential.

I would be grateful if you could consider my request and make the necessary changes to the budget classification system.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
